## Overview

The Shopify Upsell Integration is a powerful extension designed to help store owners boost their sales by offering upsell items during the checkout process. With this app, store owners can select specific products to be displayed as upsell recommendations on the checkout page, encouraging customers to add more items to their cart with a single click.

## Features

- **Easy Product Selection**: Store owners can choose upsell products directly from within the app.
- **Database Integration**: Selected upsell products are saved in the appâ€™s database for quick access.
- **Checkout Page Extension**: A seamless integration into Shopify's checkout UI to display upsell recommendations.
- **One-Click Add to Cart**: Customers can add upsell items to their cart with a single click during checkout.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Helps increase average order value without disrupting the checkout flow.

## How It Works

1. **Store Owner Setup:**
   - Navigate to the app section within our app.
   - Select products to be used for upselling.
   - Save the selection, which is stored in the appâ€™s database.

2. **Customer Checkout Experience:**
   - When a customer proceeds to checkout, the app dynamically retrieves the upsell products selected by the store owner.
   - These products appear in a **'You may also like'** section on the checkout page.
   - Customers can add any of the recommended products with a single click before completing their purchase.

## Technology Stack
